# Micro Frontend Architecture with Angular 

Cloud native applications benefit from Microservices architecture. By decouple business domains we are able to independently scale, reduce friction, increase fault tolerance and solve many problems associated with monolithic architectures. However, the UI Applications still follow monolithic architecture, covering the entire sub-domain. Can we apply the same to Monolithic UI Applications ? The answer is yes. This repo is created to consolidate guiding principles for building micro-front ends. Although it is not limited to any particular framework like Angular, React or Vue, this repo contains sample code for building microfront ends using Angular.  

## Micro frontend (MF)

A microfront end is a client side architecture, where each component is responsible only for one sub-domain of the business. A common shell is used to load the components.

## Features 

List of key features of a micro-front end architecture.
- Owned by one team - One team owns one or more micro-frontends. The team is responsible for the module instead of an individual.
- Shared state management - Make sure that your micro app is not containing a data store state, it has to be separated into a shareable data layer. 
- Independent deployment - Each of the micro-apps has to be deployed individually as they are hosted in a separate domain. Also, make sure to make each of the pipelines as decoupled as possible.
- Decouple Components (Shared UI Library**) - The components should not have any direct interaction. 
- Fault Tolerance -  If one of the micro-app is broken, the other will still be functioning

## Important Concepts 

It is important to understand below concepts before moving forward and understanding Microfrontend architecture using Angular / NX

### Monorepo

Conceptualie by Google, Monorepo (in the contex of Angular) is a single repository which contains the Angular code for all the applications developed by an organization as though they are one. This is primarily done to promote code reuse, patterns and practces.

Angular provides a way to set up one workspace with multiple projects and libraries sharing the same dependencies across all projects.

Key Components of Angular Monorepo
- Apps (only UI)
- Lib
  - App-Lib 
    - App specific logic - state management, http client library
    - Should be replacable
    - Should be able to expose key functionality only.
    - Technology agnostic.
  - Shared
    - Utils (libs shared by all Applications - logging, authentication)
    - UI (Shared UI components)

Alternatives: BIT.dev, lerna.js.org, Git Sub modules 

### NX CLI

NX [NX](https://nx.dev/) makes creating and managing monorepo easy. 
- It is a smart, fast and extensible build system with first class monorepo support and powerful integrations. 
- NX provides several npm run scripts to run each project and do other things. 
- It is easy to learn as most of the commands replicate existing ng functionality.

### Module Federation

Introduced in Webpack 5. Module federation targets to solve below problems

-  Builds can become unacceptably slow (Webpack assume that the entire program code is available when compiling.)
-  Long dev-server startup times
-  Splitting the SPA into multiple projects leads to 
   -  Cognitive overhead 
   -  Coordinating build and deployment
   -  Version-Mismatch-Hell 
   -  Sharing state

Module federation is:
- Composable: Module Federation provides a solution to the scaling problem by allowing a Single Page Application (SPA) to be sliced into multiple smaller remote applications.
- Remote load: These applications can be built, deployed independently and are not yet known at compile time. 
- Optimized: Federated code can always load its dependencies but will attempt to use the consumersâ€™ dependencies before downloading more payload. 

#### Dynamic Module Federation.

Dynamic Module Federation allows you to build once and deploy everywhere, across environments.
